# Mid-Term Report

## Week 0: Kernel Build and Virtual Machine Setup
Got started by building a Linux kernel and setting it up using a virtual machine. Didn’t dive too deep, but it gave me a rough idea of how the kernel runs and how a VM can be useful for testing without messing up the main system.

## Week 1: Processes and Kernel Interaction
This week, I learned about how processes run in user mode and kernel mode, and how the kernel handles things like traps, system calls, and virtual memory. The assignments were especially useful—they helped me understand how processes use memory and how the OS manages them. I also got to write a basic loadable kernel module, which was my first proper interaction with kernel-space code.

## Week 2: System Calls and Process Management
We went deeper into process-related system calls like fork(), exec(), and wait(). This week really helped me get a clearer picture of how child and parent processes work, and how the OS controls them. The assignment where we implemented a mini shell using these system calls made things click—it showed how low-level these operations are and how much control we can have over process behavior.

## Week 3 – Memory Management & Address Translation
Learnt in depth about virtual and physical memory, address translation, segmentation, paging, and how these concepts help the OS manage memory efficiently and ensure process isolation.
The classes helped build a stronger intuition for how memory is organized and accessed in modern operating systems. (Didnt do the assignment yet)
